**_Lead Developer & Digital System Architect based in Pandeglang._**

Dedicated to orchestrating digital transformation within the educational sector. With a robust command of modern web technologies, I strive to bridge the gap between complex back-end logic and elegant front-end experiences.

Beyond the code, I am a problem solver committed to building efficient, scalable, and user-centric applications. When not architecting the next system update, you can find me exploring emerging tech trends or enjoying the serene atmosphere of Pandeglang.

_Let's innovate and build the future of education together._
